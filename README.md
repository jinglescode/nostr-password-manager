---

Vault utilizes zero-knowledge encryption to safeguard your data while storing it on NOSTR network for enhanced resilience.

Vault saves all your passwords and notes securely by encrypting your data twice; once with your secret key and once with your passcode.

Your data are not stored on any centralized server, but rather on a set of relay servers. This means that it is resilient to attacks and that you are the only one who can access your passwords.

Security experts recommend that you use a different, randomly generated password for every account that you create, and Vault makes this easy. Vault can generate passwords and store them for you, this means that you only need to remember one password, your passcode.

Looking to store and swiftly retrieve your data? Vaults facilitate searchable items, allowing you to effortlessly copy the desired information with a single click.

Vault is free, open source, and decentralized; and will always be.
